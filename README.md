# Deno by Example

This repository contains the source code for https://examples.deno.land/.

Deno by Example is a collection of small snippets showcasing various functions
of the APIs implemented in Deno.

- Examples are written in TypeScript
- Each example should be a single file, no more than 50 lines
- Each example should be a self-contained unit, and should depend on no
  dependencies other than Deno builtins and the standard library (exceptions can
  be made)
- Each example should be runnable without addional dependencies on all systems
  (exceptions can be made for platform specific functionality)
- Examples should be introduce at most one (or in exceptional cases two or
  three) concepts in Deno / Web APIs. Existing concepts should be linked to.
- Code should be kept _really simple_, and should be easy to read and understand
  by anyone. Do not use complicated code constructs, or hard to follow builtins
  like `Array.reduce`
- Concepts introduced in an example should be explained
